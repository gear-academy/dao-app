# Gear DAO dApp

[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/gear-tech/dao-app)

Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) operates without central authority or control. It is community-driven and all the decisions are made through proposals in which different members are required to vote.

It's Ready-to-Use application based on two different smart-contracts:

- Fundible Token [https://github.com/gear-tech/apps/tree/master/fungible-token](https://github.com/gear-tech/apps/tree/master/fungible-token) which permit to create utility token `DAO`
- DAO contract [https://github.com/gear-tech/apps/tree/master/dao](https://github.com/gear-tech/apps/tree/master/dao)

# Getting Started

```shell
